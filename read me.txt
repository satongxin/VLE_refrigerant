1. The sample files are used for VLE calculations particularly for refrigerants applying difference thermodynamic methods. 

2. The codes are not written in the most efficient way and the robustness is not guranteed. Users may need to tune some parameters for better numerical convergence. 

3. All files are recommanded to be put under the default MATLAB search path. 

4. The main function is provided in "VLE_calculation.m". The remaining scripts are thermodynamic routines. Parameter databases are included as well as ".mat" files.
